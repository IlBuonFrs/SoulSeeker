[FROST DK TALENT] 

Hello!

I'm use dk since the first patch of WoTLK and i want to alert for one talent that limit the dual-wielding.

The talent "Threat of Thassarian" at Rank at Rank 3 in frost spec says: "When dual-wielding, your Death Strikes, Obliterates, Plague Strikes, Rune Strikes, Blood Strikes and Frost Strikes have a 100% chance to also deal damage with your offhand weapon." but for now the damage is just lesser than the first strike. I've tryied Obliterate and Frost Strike with the same weapon and with 2 different weapon but the result was the same: different damage. 

Following down some screenshots that i've made.
